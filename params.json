  "body": "The [Digital Marmor Parium](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/dmp/) is a project of the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig. The aim of this work is to produce a new digital edition of the so called Marmor Parium (Parian Marble), which is a Hellenistic chronicle on marble coming from the Greek island of Paros. The importance of the document is due to the fact that it preserves a Greek chronology (1581/80-299/98 BC) with a list of Athenian kings and archons accompanied by short references to historical and cultural events. The project team is producing a new XML edition of the text according to the [EpiDoc Guidelines](http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/), is annotating the morphology and the syntax of the text, encoding all the named entities (people and places), and producing a timeline visualization of the chronological information preserved on the stone.\r\n\r\n* [EpiDoc versions of the Marmor Parium](https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/DigitalMarmorParium/tree/master/EpiDoc_versions)\r\n* [Treebank data](http://www.perseids.org/tools/arethusa/app/#/perseids?chunk=1&doc=5891) (downloadable from Arethusa)\r\n* [The geography of the Marmor Parium](http://pelagios.org/recogito/documents/116/map) (through Pelagios)\r\n* [The chronology of the Marmor Parium](http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline/latest/embed/index.html?source=0AuQPAtZsvM9qdDJPakdWS3BTODM3dkNfU2Y5NURhWlE&amp;font=Bevan-PotanoSans&amp;maptype=toner&amp;lang=en&amp;height=650)",
