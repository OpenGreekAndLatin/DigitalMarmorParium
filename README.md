# Digital Marmor Parium

The [Digital Marmor Parium](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/projects/open-greek-and-latin-project/digital-marmor-parium/) is a project of the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig. The aim of this work is to produce a new digital edition of the so called Marmor Parium (Parian Marble), which is a Hellenistic chronicle on marble coming from the Greek island of Paros. The importance of the document is due to the fact that it preserves a Greek chronology (1581/80-299/98 BC) with a list of Athenian kings and archons accompanied by short references to historical and cultural events. The project team is producing a new XML edition of the text according to the EpiDoc Guidelines, is annotating the morphology and the syntax of the text, encoding all the named entities (people and places), and producing a timeline visualization of the chronological information preserved on the stone.
